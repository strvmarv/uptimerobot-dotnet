git push origin v2.0.0-rc.1
```

### 2. Create GitHub Release

1. Go to: https://github.com/strvmarv/uptimerobot-dotnet/releases/new
2. Select tag: `v2.0.0-rc.1`
3. Release title: `v2.0.0-rc.1 - Release Candidate`
4. Mark as: **‚úÖ Pre-release**
5. Release notes template:

```markdown
# v2.0.0-rc.1 - Release Candidate

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a pre-release version for testing purposes. Do not use in production without thorough testing.**

## What's New in v2.0

This release candidate includes all planned features for v2.0.0:

### Major Features
- ‚ú® Complete API coverage: Monitors, Alert Contacts, Maintenance Windows, Status Pages
- üéØ Strongly-typed enums (no more magic numbers)
- üîÑ Automatic pagination with `IAsyncEnumerable`
- üõ°Ô∏è Nullable reference types throughout
- üöÄ .NET 9.0 support (plus .NET 8.0, 6.0, and Standard 2.0)
- üìù Comprehensive XML documentation
- ‚ö° Performance optimizations

### Breaking Changes
- **Property Naming**: All properties now use PascalCase (was snake_case)
- **Enum Types**: Monitor types, statuses, etc. are now strongly-typed enums
- **Method Names**: Updated to async naming conventions (e.g., `GetMonitorsAsync()`)
- **Exception Types**: New custom exception hierarchy

## Installation

Install the release candidate:

```bash
dotnet add package UptimeRobotDotnet --version 2.0.0-rc.1
```

## Testing & Feedback

We need your help to make v2.0.0 stable! Please test:

1. Migration from v1.x
2. All API endpoints
3. Pagination with large datasets
4. Exception handling
5. Multi-framework compatibility

**Report Issues**: [Create an issue](https://github.com/strvmarv/uptimerobot-dotnet/issues/new) with the "v2.0.0-rc" label

## Migration Guide

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/strvmarv/uptimerobot-dotnet/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed migration instructions.

### Quick Migration Example

```csharp
// v1.x
var parameters = new MonitorCreateParameters
{
    Friendly_Name = "My Monitor",
    Type = 1,  // HTTP
    Custom_Http_Headers = headers
};
var result = await client.MonitorCreate(parameters);

// v2.0.0-rc.1
var parameters = new MonitorCreateParameters
{
    FriendlyName = "My Monitor",
    Type = MonitorType.HTTP,  // Strongly-typed
    CustomHttpHeaders = headers
};
var result = await client.CreateMonitorAsync(parameters);
```
